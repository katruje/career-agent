**Codename: Rōdōsha (労働者) — The Agent That Seeks Opportunity**

`career-agent` is an AI-powered assistant designed to manage the full job application lifecycle autonomously. It collects user intent, tailors resumes and cover letters, performs job searches, and can even coordinate outreach and submissions.

## 🧱 Architecture
This agent is being developed using [Kikon-tai](https://github.com/katruje/kikon-tai), a modular AI development framework built around autonomous task execution and agent collaboration.

Each core function (resume generation, job search, communication) is handled by a specialized sub-agent.

## 🔍 Status
Currently in design phase. Tasks and roadmap are managed through Kikon-tai's autonomous loop.
