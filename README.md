**Codename: Rōdōsha (労働者) — The Agent That Seeks Opportunity**

`career-agent` is an AI-powered assistant designed to manage the full job application lifecycle autonomously. It collects user intent, tailors resumes and cover letters, performs job searches, and can even coordinate outreach and submissions.

---

## 🎯 Features
- Interviews the user to understand current goals, preferences, and skills
- Tailors resume and cover letter output based on job postings
- Performs job listing analysis and tracking
- Optional agent roles for recruiter outreach or scheduling
- Future expansion: career coaching, professional development, portfolio planning

## 🧱 Architecture
This agent is being developed using [Kikon-tai](https://github.com/katruje/kikon-tai), a modular AI development framework built around autonomous task execution and agent collaboration.

Each core function (resume generation, job search, communication) is handled by a specialized sub-agent.

## 🔍 Status
Currently in design phase. Tasks and roadmap are managed through Kikon-tai's autonomous loop.

## 🤖 Agent-Generated Pull Requests

This repository is partially maintained by an AI automation system called [**Kikon-tai**](https://github.com/katruje/kikon-tai).

Agent-created pull requests follow a naming and tagging convention to distinguish them from human-authored PRs:

- **Branch names** begin with `auto/`, e.g., `auto/initial-pr`
- **PR titles** begin with `🤖 Kikon-tai:` to denote agent authorship
- **PR bodies** include metadata such as:
  - Task ID
  - Agent name
  - Summary of automated action

### Merge Workflow

- PRs generated by agents can be automatically approved **only if James is not listed as a reviewer**.
- When James **is** the reviewer, a manual approval is required. Leave a comment like `LGTM` or `Approved` to signal readiness to merge.

> *This agent is part of an ongoing exploration of autonomous personal tooling. The codename "Rōdōsha" (労働者) was chosen to reflect the agent’s purpose: to move on your behalf, tirelessly and without ego, in search of new work.*
